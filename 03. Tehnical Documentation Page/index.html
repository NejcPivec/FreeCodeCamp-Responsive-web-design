          Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
          language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
          Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
          notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
          object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical
          code for small and large-scale projects.

        <p>
          To get started with writing Python, open the Scratchpad and write your
          first "Hello world" Python code:
        </p>
        <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
        </p>
        <p>
          A function can return data as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
        </p>
        <code
          >def my_function(): print("Hello from a function") my_function()
        </code>
      </section>

          There are four collection data types in the Python programming
          language:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows
            duplicate members.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows
            duplicate members.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate
            members.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and
            indexed. No duplicate members.
          </li>
          <li>
            They are cool.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the
          properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data
          set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in
          efficiency or security.
        </p>
        <code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] print(thislist)</code>
        <code
          >thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] for x in thislist:
          print(x)</code

          A package contains all the files you need for a module. Modules are
          Python code libraries you can include in your project.
        </p>
        <code>pip install camelcase</code>
